});


#Create collections -- Collections are similar to tables in database
db.createCollection('customers');

#See collections in this db
show collections


#Insert documents in the collection - "customers"
db.customers.insert({firstname:"Shubham",lastname:"roy",sex:"Male"});

#to see documents in the collection - "customers"
db.customers.find();

#insert array of documents in the collection - "customers"
db.customers.insert([{firstname:"Joe",lastname:"Turner",sex:"Male"},{firstname:"Asha",lastname:"Sebi",sex:"Female"}]);

#find command with pretty looking result
db.customers.find().pretty();

#update a document - the first bracket is like the where condition in sql
db.customers.update({firstname:"Shubham"},{firstname:"Shubham",lastname:"Choudhury",Sex:"Male"});
-- here we have to give all the fields for update, else it will remove the field not 
given and only update the field given

#update a document - only update the field needed and not give all the fields
db.customers.update({firstname:"Shubham"},{$set:{lastname:"RoyC"}});
